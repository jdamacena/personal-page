# Junior Damacena's mobile-development-related blog

This is my blog, it's made with Jekyll and based on the [Type on Strap theme](https://github.com/Sylhare/Type-on-Strap#type-on-strap), and here I post all sorts of things about mobile development and things related to Android and Xamarin.

If you have interest on what I do, you may want to follow me on social media where I'm _almost_ always active (if I'm not programming, or studying, or reading).
